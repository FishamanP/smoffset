A simple tool to quickly adjust the offset of Stepmania simfiles.
.SM and .SSC are supported. Really, anything that uses #OFFSET: lines is supported.

Fair warning, this has only been tested on a single Windows configuration.
Should be cross-platform, but there is a very real risk of loss of your simfile!

**BACK UP YOUR SIMFILES BEFORE USE, THIS HAS NOT BEEN THROUGHLY TESTED**
